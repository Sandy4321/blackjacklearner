# blackjacklearner
A example of Q-learning written in Python for a simplified Blackjack implementation.

This project provides a simple implementation of Blackjack for Q-learning. The Learner is trained via the standard algorithm, 
and once training has completed, will play the game to determine a win/loss ratio for the training session. 

The number of training and game rounds are parameters found in the main function. The results of the training are updated (printed to the screen)
periodically, and the win/loss ratio is reported in the same manner.
